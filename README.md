Here is the checklist that one needs to check before sending a PR:

1. No print_r, var_dump or similar calls exist
2. Code is not repeated or duplicated
3. The code works
4. Follows coding conventions
5. Code is Understandable
6. Names are simple and should describe the usage-- function or variable
7. There is no commented out code
8. Comments should indicate WHY rather that WHAT the code is doing
9.  No sensitive information is logged or visible
10. Avoid nested If loops
11. Use try and catch if possible.
